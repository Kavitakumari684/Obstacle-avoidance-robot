Obstacle Avoidance RobotObstacle Avoidance Robot
Developed Embedded C code and Made the hardware connection on Proteus software. In which used AT89C51 microcontroller(8051-family) ,four IR sensor ,2-DC motor ,L293D motor driver.
1. Obstacle detected in right direction in this case left motor will rotate in anticlockwise and other right motor will rotate in clockwise.
2. Obstacle detected in left direction in this case left motor will rotate in clockwise and other right motor will rotate in anticlockwise.
3. Obstacle detected in front direction in this case left/right motor will rotate in anticlockwise.
4. Obstacle detected in both front/backward direction in this case left motor will stop the rotation.
5. No obstacle detected in any direction then both motor will rotate clockwise direction.
